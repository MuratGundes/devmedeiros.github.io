Hi! My name is Jaqueline Medeiros and I am a Data Scientist from Brazil. I have a degree in Statistics and most of my experience has been with data analysis and visualization. Even so, I've been showing interest in data engineering, I've been participating in projects involving this branch of data science. I'm currently working on implementing PySpark and Apache Hop to make data cleaning faster and more efficient.

Even though I want to focus on data engineering, I'm still interested in machine learning, data analysis, and other things under the data science umbrella. So I'll still be posting about data science in general.
