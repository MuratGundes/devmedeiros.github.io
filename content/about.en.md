Hi! My name is Jaqueline Souza Medeiros and I’m a Data Scientist who graduated from the Federal University of Goiás in Brazil. The primary purpose of this blog is to write about what I have learned and continue to learn about Data Science.

I love learning about other cultures and languages, and because of this, I’ve come to have a great interest in Natural Language Processing. Also, I am interested in simulation and machine learning, so I hope to explore these areas soon.
