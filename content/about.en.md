I’m a Statistician who graduated from the Federal University of Goiás in Brazil. The primary purpose of this blog is to write about what I have learned and continue to learn about Data Science.

I love learning about other cultures and languages and because of this I've come to have a great interest in Natural Language Processing. Also, I am interested in simulation and machine learning, so I hope to be able to explore these areas soon.

My hobbies are yoga, D&D and playing with my cats.
