Hi! My name is Jaqueline Medeiros and I am a Data Analyst from Brazil. I've been interested in data engineering, participating in projects involving this branch of data science. I'm currently working with Apache Hop to make data wrangling automatic.

Even though I want to focus on data engineering, I'm still interested in machine learning, data analysis, and other things under the data science umbrella. So I'll be posting about data science in general.
