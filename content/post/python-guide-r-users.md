**Python Guide for R Users** is an upcoming project where I'm writing a guide to Python to help people who already know how to program in R or are just familiar with it and are learning/transitioning to Python.

The project is going to be available [here](https://devmedeiros.com/python-guide-r-users). Feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/devmedeiros/python-guide-r-users) to the project if you notice anything missing or incorrect.
