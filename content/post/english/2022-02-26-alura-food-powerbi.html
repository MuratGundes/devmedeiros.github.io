<p>This dashboard is the <strong>second of three</strong> that I'm making in the following weeks as part of the second Alura Challenge BI.</p>

<p><strong>Alura Food</strong> is interested in expanding its business by entering the Indian market. To do so, the company asked to calculate measures to help them make a better decision.</p>
<p>First of all, I merged the datasets and cleaned the data through Power BI, translated a few texts from English to Portuguese through Google Sheets, and converted the meals price from their respective currency value to BRL (Brazillian Currency). Finally, I used Figma to make the background, including images and titles.</p>
<p>In this project, I opted to used a single page to display all the requested information as I believe it makes it easier to analyze the data.</p>
<p>Most restaurants in this Indian market don't offer online delivery, with just 19.21% having it. The average rating for the restaurants is 3.72 out of a maximum of 5, the rating is also presented as text, with a <em>Muito Bom</em> (Very Good) being a score over 4.</p>
<p>The average price of a meal per person is around R$ 39.48 (around USD 7.65). And there are 9577 different restaurants in the dataset, of which 3968, specialize in North Indian cuisine. New Delhi is, by far, the most popular choice to open a restaurant with 5473, the second closest city is Gurgaon, with 1118 restaurants.</p>
