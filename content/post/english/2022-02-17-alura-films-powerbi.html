<p>This dashboard is the first of three that I'll be making in the following weeks as part of the second Alura Challenge BI.</p>

<p>The objective of this dashboard is to help find the best selection for an upcoming movie.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I explored in the first tab a little summary about the movies in the database, with this you can get a general view of our data. The second tab is displayed the IMDB and Meta Score of the movies. I also created a measure to show how much both measurements agree. A score of 100 means <strong>doesn't agree at all</strong> and 0 means <strong>completely agree</strong>, the agreeable score was 9.48.</p>
<p>Our third tab shows information about the movie stars, the top 10 actors with the highest movie gross revenue, and the top 10 actors with the biggest movie count.</p>
<p>The fourth tab presents the distribution of gross revenue by how many different genres a movie has. It also shows how many movies have a given genre, for example, <strong>Drama</strong> is the most popular choice for movie genre, with 72% of movies in the dataset. At last, this tab also shows the mean gross revenue by genre.</p>
<p>The fifth and last tab shows a bit of information about the Brazillian Parental Guide and shows the average Meta Score for movies by the parental guide certification. It also shows how much gross revenue, on average, each parental guide certification earned.</p>
