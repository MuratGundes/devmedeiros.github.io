Here are 5 Tips to improve your Power BI Dashboards.

## 1- Color scheme

Unless you are working with a particular company that has defined rules on branding and how their logos and pamphlets should be displayed, deciding which colors to use will be a big part of your dashboard designing.

When starting, it may not be easy to choose a color scheme with confidence. You may find yourself always going for monochromatic with black and white. To end this and bring more life to your dashboards you can use the assistance of websites or apps that suggest a color scheme for you. The suggestions are based on color harmony rules and you can get something unique for each dashboard that you make. You can easily find a website to help you with that, just look up the color wheel, particularly I like to use [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/). For the color harmony rule, I recommend using the _Triad_ and/or _Complementary_. You can just choose a color to start and the site will update your suggestions instantly or you can just keep refreshing until you find something you like.

One of the reasons I like _triad_ and _complementary_ is because when I want to make something pop on a dashboard it becomes really easy to do so, without compromising the aesthetic of the whole thing.

## 2- Bookmarks

Take advantage of Power BI bookmarks and selection tools (show/hide). Combining these two tools you can make a more responsive dashboard, where you can have buttons that opens a small window with information or a small graph that didn’t fit the overall look of the dashboard. You can also, use it to make multiple pages on your dashboard, a ‘clean all filters’ button, or as a way to guide the visualization of your dashboard.

## 3- Wallpaper and Background

Setting up a wallpaper image can make your dashboard stand out. But you need to choose carefully what kind of image you use. You don’t want to use something that will have a lot of details, as it can draw attention away from your data.

One of my go-to wallpaper images is a gradient image and [coolors](https://coolors.co/gradient-maker/87f4b5-93cbf1) make this easy for you. You can select the colors you want, how you want the gradient to be and it will generate an image for you that you can download and use it. If you prefer a minimalist approach you can just go for a solid color wallpaper.

Don’t forget. You can set the wallpaper image as transparent as well, so if you think the color is too strong, try it out with some level of transparency.

On top of your wallpaper, you can have a transparent background, you can play around with the percentages to see what is a better fit for you.

## 4- Shadows

Shadows are an excellent tool to use. When used correctly can add just enough depth to make your dashboard less boring, but if you used it too much it can become a noisy experience. So as a rule of thumb, if you have a lot of visuals on a page, choose one type of visual (I prefer box values) to be different from the others, usually, you’d go for something that you want them to draw their attention to. Suppose you have a pretty flat dashboard, with not much going on, you can use an inside shadow on your graph and make it distinctive from everything else. But avoid using shadows on different types of visuals and different types of shadows.

## 5- Make a Theme

So, you know what colors you’re going to use, decided what fonts you like and how you like to present your charts and graphs. It’s time to make your life easier and just make a theme.

There is a Power BI theme generator by [PowerBI.Tips](https://themes.powerbi.tips/), with this website you can set up your color scheme (palette) and set up all the visuals properties. When you finish you can just download it and use it as a default option. This will make your life easier because you won’t need to go over basic selections like selecting a font every time you create a visual. And even if you want a particular visual to be different you’ll still be able to change it however you want.
