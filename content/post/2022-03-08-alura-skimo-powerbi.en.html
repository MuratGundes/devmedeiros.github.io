<p><strong>Alura Skimo</strong> is interested in analyzing their sales data, to help with this I made this dashboard. It’s composed of three pages. The first one presents a summary of all the main measures you’ll find in the dashboard, filtered for the most recent month. On this first page, you can also rest your mouse cursor over a measure and it’ll show a small plot with the historical series with a tendency line.</p>
<p>Moving on to the next page, you can see all the information about the products sold by <strong>Alura Skimo</strong>. You can filter the data by ice cream flavor, type of package, category, and product cost. It displayed the basic information about the products, along with a rank of the best-selling products and a couple of plots showing the sales by flavor and sales by category.</p>
<p>On the last page, you can find information about the salesperson from our company. It shows when they joined the company, how much is their cut, how much revenue they got and how many sales each one made, everything in the last year (2018).</p>
<p>This dashboard is complex next to the other two because our dataset came from SQL files. First, I had to create the database and load each SQL file into it, then all I had to do was load it on Power BI. At last, I did all the data cleaning and processing on it.</p>
<p>If you want to look at the project files and code you can find it in my <a href="https://github.com/devmedeiros/Alura-Challenge-BI-2/tree/main/Alura%20Skimo">github repository</a>.</p>
